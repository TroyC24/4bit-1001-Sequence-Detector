# 4bit-1001-Sequence-Detector
4bit (1001) Sequence Detector using Finite State Moore Machine in Verilog with testbench
A Sequential Input of 1001 will result in an output of 1. 
End of a sequence can be used as the start of the next sequence, for example, an input of 1001001 will output a 1 after both the second and third 1.
